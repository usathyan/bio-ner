Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromatin in the nucleus, restricting the 
binding of transcription factors (TFs) to their target DNA sites. FOXA1 
functions as a pioneer TF to bind condensed chromatin and initiate the opening 
of local chromatin for gene expression. However, the principles of FOXA1 
recruitment and how it subsequently unpacks the condensed chromatin remain 
elusive. Here, we revealed that FOXA1 intrinsically forms submicron-sized 
condensates through its N- and C-terminal intrinsically disordered regions 
(IDRs). Notably, both IDRs enable FOXA1 to dissolve the condensed chromatin. In 
addition, the DNA-binding capacity of FOXA1 contributes to its ability to both 
form condensates and dissolve condensed chromatin. Further genome-wide 
investigation showed that IDRs enable FOXA1 to bind and unpack the condensed 
chromatin to regulate the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. 
This work provides a principle of how pioneer TFs function to initiate competent 
chromatin states using their IDRs.
